# Scripted Text Animator

## Introduction
Scripted Text Animator is an application which turns a simple instruction script into an animation.

It was created to facilitate the text effect in movies where you see the text being typed on the screen, without having to get to grips with either video rendering or plugins for the movie studio.

- Render; Turn an instruction script into an animation
- Projects; Save current work and reload previous sessions
